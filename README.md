# cfx-api-botv2
This bot uses the cfx-api module released in August 2022 by [Pablo-1610]( https://forum.cfx.re/u/pablo-1610/) on the Cfx.re forum, but without posting a document to date for the use of NodeJS variables, consequently in the last few days I have started studying the source code and have been able to exploit it with good potential.
